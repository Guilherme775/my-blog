Hello there, I'm Guilherme or KindaSloth if you prefer!

I'm a SWE at [Blockade Labs](https://twitter.com/BlockadeLabs), currently working on [Skybox](https://skybox.blockadelabs.com/) and some other projects.

In this blog I'll try to write about some cool tech stuff, I have the most interest in:

- Functional Programming
- Compilers
- Type theory
- Game dev
- Code-related stuff in general

My Twitter DM is always open, so feel free to reach me anytime :)
