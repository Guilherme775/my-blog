Hello there, I'm Guilherme or KindaSloth if you prefer!

I'm a SWE at [Blockade Games](https://blockade.games/), currently working on [Neon District](https://neondistrict.io/).

In this blog I'll try to write about some cool tech stuff, I have the most interest in:

- Functional Programming
- Type theory
- Compilers
- Game dev

My Twitter DM is always open, so feel free to reach me anytime :)
