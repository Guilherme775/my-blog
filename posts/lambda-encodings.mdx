## Basic idea

For this post I'll presume that you already have at least a basic knowledge about the Lambda 
Calculus. 

So you probably know that the Lambda Calculus is composed of variables, lambdas, and 
applications, but how we can create real programs just using pure lambda calculus? 

In this post, I will explain some ways to do lambda encoding, i.e. how to encode values or 
structures in lambda calculus.

## Types of encodings

#### Church encoding

Church encoding is a way to represent data and operators in the lambda calculus.

The method is named for Alonzo Church, who first encoded data in the lambda calculus this way. 

#### Scott encoding

Scott encoding is a way to represent recursive data types in the lambda calculus.

The method is named for Dana Scott.

## Encoding Booleans and If/Else using Church encoding

```js
// Church Boolean (True)
// λt.λf.t
const True = t => f => t;

// Church Boolean (False)
// λt.λf.f
const False = t => f => f;

// Church Conditional (If/Else)
// λp.λa.λb.p a b
const IfElse = p => a => b => p(a)(b);

/*
  if (condition) {
    return 0;
  } else {
    return 1;
  }
*/
IfElse(True)(0)(1); // 0
IfElse(False)(0)(1); // 1
```

## Encoding ADTs and Pattern Matching using Scott encoding

```js
/*
  Haskell version

  data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat

  predecessor n = case n of
    Zero -> Zero
    Succ n -> n
*/

// λzero.λsucc.zero
const Zero = zero => succ => zero;

// λnat.λzero.λsucc.succ nat
const Succ = nat => zero => succ => succ(nat);

// λnat.λzero.λsucc.nat zero succ
const natCase = nat => zero => succ => nat(zero)(succ);

// λnat. natCase nat Zero (λn.n)
const predecessor = nat => natCase(nat)(Zero)(n => n);

predecessor(Zero); // Zero
predecessor(Succ(Zero)); // Zero
predecessor(Succ(Succ(Zero))); // Succ(Zero)
```

## Typed versions

These two simple examples show us how to encode data and datatypes using only pure lambda 
calculus. 

The most brilliant thing is that we can also use the same methods to encode data and datatypes 
using some typed versions of Lambda Calculus like [System F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_F).

And that's it! I hope that you enjoyed reading this post. Thanks for your attention!
